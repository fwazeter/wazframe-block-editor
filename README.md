# WazFrame Block Editor

This module adds editor components for the WordPress / Gutenberg block editor that
can be shared between blocks. **Early alpha** with lots of breaking changes to come as
well as more updates and robust abilities.

## Installation

Install using `npm install @wazframe/block-editor`

## Usage

Heavily used in the wazframe/layout block library for use in the WazFrame plugin, a plugin for WordPress that makes CSS easier to work with.

### WazFrame 

Plugin for WordPress that fixes a lot of the quirkiness in CSS generation in WordPress (early development), and
enables a more robust block system for easier layout composition in WordPress Block Themes / Gutenberg.

### WazFrame Layout

Block library of layout primitives that can be used independently or with the WazFrame plugin. This library
powers the core basic blocks inside WazFrame.
